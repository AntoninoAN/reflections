What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the .git file, where it will store all commits and messages needed for running GIT!
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Gives you the control to restring which files will be part of the commit and give you the changes to order your logic for every commit.
